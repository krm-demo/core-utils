<hr/>
Examples of using <b><code>th-tool</code></b> to process the directories
is demonstrated at simple <a href="th-test-site/original/index.html">test site</a>,
which is very straight-forward with a lot of duplicated elements,
but it's exactly how most of generated sites look like. So, <b><code>th-tool</code></b>-tags
and expression are inserted <b>before</b> and processed <b>after</b> that third-party site-generator.
In our main build-flow that third-party site-generator is a standard <b><code>javadoc</code></b>-tool,
which comes with every installation of JDK. As for our <a href="th-test-site/original/index.html">test site</a>
- it's just a demonstration and emulation of some typical cases.
