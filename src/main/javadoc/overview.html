This is an entry point of standard project documentation without test-results,
test-coverage and more advanced examples and samples of usage.

<div style="border: 1px solid red">
  I'm a DIV from <code>'./src/main/javadoc/overview.html'</code>
  <br/>
  This line is a part of test that must appear in the next <b>internal release</b>
</div>

<hr/>
  Examples of using <b><code>th-tool</code></b> to process the directories
  is demonstrated at simple <a href="th-test-site/original">test site</a>,
  which is very straight-forward with a lot of duplicated elements,
  but it's exactly how most of generated sites look like. So, <b><code>th-tool</code></b>-tags
  and expression are inserted <b>before</b> and processed <b>after</b> that third-party site-generator.
  In our main build-flow that third-party site-generator is a standard <b><code>javadoc</code></b>-tool,
  which comes with every installation of JDK. As for our <a href="th-test-site/original">test site</a>
  - it's just a demonstration and emulation of some typical cases.
