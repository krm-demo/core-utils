# <u>core-utils</u>

This Java-library contains utility-classes to simplify working with core-java API (streams, collections, io, ...).
It was initially created as a core and reusable part of **`th-tool`** (which is not published yet).
Some features and approaches could be very useful and helpful independently as a separate Java-library
that could be easily integrated into any Java-project as a maven/gradle artifact or as a dependency to jbang-script.

Full documentation (including JavDoc) and examples fort this particular version are available [here]()
The root page of project-site is a release-catalog with list of all ever generated versions,
