# <u>`core-utils:21.04.006-SNAPSHOT`</u>

This Java-library contains utility-classes to simplify working with core-java API (streams, collections, input-output).
It was initially created as a core and reusable part of **`th-tool`** and some features and approaches could be
very useful and helpful independently as a separate Java-library that could be integrated into any project
as a maven/gradle artifact or as a dependency to jbang-script.

Full documentation (including JavDoc) and examples fort this particular version are available [here]()
