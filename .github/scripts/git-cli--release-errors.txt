If something is going wrong during INTERNAL-release or PUBLIC-release the state of project in git-repository becomes INVALID.
In order to reanimate it before re-execute "release-internal" or "release-public" following steps should be done:

1. First of all `git pull origin` to fetch the latest changes (first of all the result of upgrading the version in "pom.xml").

2. Most probably, the version in "pom.xml" does not have "-SNAPSHOT"-qualifier - so it's necessary to add it manually:
- for example if it's "21.23.002", then you have to change it tp "21.23.002-SNAPSHOT"

3. Most probably the git-tag was already created (the command `git tag` will show that) and it must be deleted:
- as for example above the command to run is `git tag -d 21.23.002`
- if the new version at 'GitHub Packages' was created it's necessary to delete the last one:
...> .github/scripts/gh-api--del-package-version-last.sh
- by the way, it looks like 'gh api' performs deleting the git-tag, but I'm not sure;

4. Then it's necessary to commit and push those changes into remote-repo, which not trivial:
- together with other fixes, that was a reason of failure, following commands must be executed:
- `git push origin --delete 21.23.002`
- other commands and fixes must be committed and pushed separately:
-- `git add .`
-- `git commit -m "some message about fixes details"`
-- `git push origin`
